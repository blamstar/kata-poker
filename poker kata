## 1. Initial Parsing of Hand

### 1.1 High Level Goal
Convert the string "2D 5S 4C 6D 7H" into an array of Card objects with fields for face value and suit.

### 1.2 Steps
- Define a Card object with two values in the constructor: the card value (integer) and the card suit (string)

- Test creating a Card object and fetching the values
    e.g. 
    new Card(2, "D")->cardValue == 2
    new Card(2, "D")->cardSuit == "D"

- Make and test a function to split a string into words by space
    e.g.   
    splitWords("4K 2D 5S") == ["4K", "2D", "5S"]

- Write tests for splitWords

- Make a function to convert a single string of two characters into a Card object
    - it will need to convert the first character from string to integer

    e.g. 
    parseCard("2D") == new Card(2, "D")

- Write tests for parseCard

- Make a function parseCards that can loop over an array of strings and call parseCard with them

    e.g.
    parseCards(["2D", "4H"])[0]->cardValue == 2

- Write tests for parseCards
